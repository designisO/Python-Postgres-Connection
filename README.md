## Python & Postgres



## Description

In this repo, I wanted to review how to connect Postgres database to Python. The module used is called "psycopg2" which allows the connection to occur using cursors. While executing the project, I was able to learn about .ini files and also setting the config.py so that the database connection info isn't shared in the app.py file itself. The database was created using PSQL which holds no tables. This project is focused on ensuring the connection only. Password of the database was removed for safety of database locally. 

### Dependencies

* Python 3.10
* Pip install psycopg2
